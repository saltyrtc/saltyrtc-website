Welcome to saltyrtc.org!

SaltyRTC is an **end-to-end encrypted signalling protocol**. It offers to
freely choose from a range of signalling tasks, such as setting up a **WebRTC**
or **ORTC** peer-to-peer connection. SaltyRTC is completely open to new and
custom signalling tasks for everything feasible.

## Specification
