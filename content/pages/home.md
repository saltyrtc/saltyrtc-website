Welcome to saltyrtc.org!

SaltyRTC is an **end-to-end encrypted signalling protocol**. It offers to
freely choose from a range of signalling tasks, such as setting up a **WebRTC**
or **ORTC** peer-to-peer connection, or even using the WebSocket based
signaling server as a relay. SaltyRTC is completely open to new and custom
signalling tasks for everything feasible.

## Getting Started

Just want to dive in and use SaltyRTC as your signalling service?
[Go ahead and get started!][getting-started]

## Specification

The specification can be found [on Github][saltyrtc-spec].
Feel free to [open an issue][saltyrtc-issues] if you have a question or want to
improve something!

## Tasks

There are currently three SaltyRTC tasks specified:
[WebRTC](https://github.com/saltyrtc/saltyrtc-meta/blob/master/Task-WebRTC.md),
[ORTC](https://github.com/saltyrtc/saltyrtc-meta/blob/master/Task-ORTC.md) and
[Relayed Data](https://github.com/saltyrtc/saltyrtc-meta/blob/master/Task-RelayedData.md).

## Demo

If you want to play around with SaltyRTC, you can try our
[demo][saltyrtc-demo]. The repository contains both an Android app and a simple
web application that can exchange text messages via signaling channel and via
WebRTC data channel.

## Source Code

SaltyRTC is free and open source. All our code can be found [on
Github](https://github.com/saltyrtc/). There's also a [list of
implementations](/pages/implementations.html).
